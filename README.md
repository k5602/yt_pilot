## Installation

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

Or build & install wheel:

```bash
python -m build
pip install dist/yt_downloader-*.whl
```

After installation a console script `yt-downloader` is available.

## Usage

Launch the Textual UI:

### Examples

Launch the TUI:

```bash
yt-downloader
```

The TUI provides an intuitive interface for configuring and starting downloads. Use the tabs to set options like quality, audio mode, captions, and advanced settings. Click "Dry Run" to preview the download plan or "Start Download" to begin.

## Configuration

You can save your preferred settings to a JSON file and use it with the `--config` flag. To save your current settings, use the `--save-config` flag.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "quality_order": ["1080p", "720p"],
  "max_concurrency": 8,
  "audio_only": false,
  "output_dir": "/path/to/downloads"
}
```

## Reporting

When `--report-format json` is used, a detailed `report.json` file is generated in the output directory for each download session. This file contains information about the downloaded videos, including their quality, size, duration, and any errors that occurred.

## Plugins

YouTube Pilot supports plugins to extend its functionality. Plugins are Python files that are loaded from `~/.config/yt-pilot/plugins`. To create a plugin, you need to create a Python file that defines a class that inherits from the `Plugin` protocol.

Example plugin:

```python
from yt_downloader.plugins import Plugin

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    name = "MyPlugin"

    def on_video_downloaded(self, context):
        video = context["video"]
        print(f"Downloaded video: {video.title}")
```

## Architecture Overview

See `docs/architecture.md` for module responsibilities.
